A large language model can be flaky
[compressors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668.pdf). How to improve reliability
of the output? One approach is to retrieval-augmented generation (Meta, 2020).

Can this approach help finding code, documentation, text passages faster?

How do we learn, when and how to use this technology?

All this does not seem to stop people to build (lots of) stuff.

## LLM tooling

Proliferation of new frameworks and tool categories. Some problems:

* download, models onto machine, copy, packaging, wrapper, customization (e.g. [ollama](https://ollama.com) to run [local models](https://github.com/miku/localmodels))
* api wrappers, adding custom data to the generation process; general libraries like [llamaindex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), with [adapters](https://llamahub.ai/), these libraries then use some paid or hosted API, like openai, claude - llama and friends; [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), ...
* running models: [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)
* ...

## Go LLM framework: lingoose

Many tools written in Python, but is there something similar in Go?

```
$ go run examples/hello.go
2024/02/27 14:41:42 using default ollama endpoint with model stablelm2:1.6b-zephyr-fp16
Thread:
user:
        Type: text
        Text: tell me a joke about geese
assistant:
        Type: text
        Text: Why did the chicken cross the road?

To get to the other side, of course!

But seriously, here's another one:

What do you call a group of geese with no leader?

A gaggle!
```

## Tasks

* setup threads, communicate with LLM via API (different options)
* loading content (e.g. wrappers aroung filetypes, data sources, like pubmed, ...)
* vector database (or just json file)

## Basic RAG example

Splitting the Go 1.22 release notes on newlines, calculating an embedding.

* takes about 4ms for short documents to create an embedding

```shell
$ go run examples/lingoose/rag/main.go
2024/02/27 18:00:11 adding 4 docs
2024/02/27 18:00:11 user interaction
Combining Data: The chosen data segments from the database are combined
        with the user’s initial query, creating an expanded prompt.
```

## Loading files

Learning from PDFs. 62 files, 146M, mostly arxiv papers.

```shell
$ go run examples/lingoose/embeddings/knowledge_base/main.go
Learning Knowledge Base...
```

## Follow up questions

* this is all "frozen RAG", where documents are added, compared, but not learned from
* would something like FAISS or ANNOY be enough, e.g. for just finding similar documents?
