## faiss

* library for efficient similarity search and clustering

> Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense
> vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size,
> up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM.

Two approaches: 1) binary vectors, quantization codes; these only use the
compressed representation, scales up to billions of vectors on a single
machine; 2) using indices (HNSW, NSG) to make search more efficient

Cf. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08734.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08734.pdf)

> Similarity search finds application in specialized database
systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically
represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing
structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this
task.

## fasttext

* C++ library to run word2vec, fast

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Similarity

* measure of distance between two points in a space
* different metrics: euclidean (real vectors), hamming (binary vectors),
  manhattan or taxicab or city block (preferred in integer feature space),
minkowski (generalization of euclidean and manhattan, with "order" parameter,
that may be used as hyperparameter), ...
* distance measure is a key in many algorithm, e.g. KNN, K-Means clustering, ...

## Vector Database

> Guessing

* stores vectors
* queries are words or paragraphs, embeddings in the vector space are calculated and the most similar vectors are retrieved
* basically similarity search

> The vectors are usually generated by applying some kind of transformation or
> embedding function to the raw data, such as text, images, audio, video, and
> others.

> [...] fast and accurate similarity search and retrieval of data based on their
> vector distance or similarity.
